    <h1>Week 3 Questions</h1>

    <h3>
      Question 9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
      eperience reference?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The portfolio references LinkedIn, Line and email. This is listed as forms
      of communication between the users and Tunatopas while allowing the users
      to learn more about them through their LinkedIn profile.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 10:What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
      should act when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It communicated that the developer encourages communication between the
      users as they seem to be more than happy to discuss their choices and
      passions for creating an immersive experience. The ‘feel free to contact
      me’ is a direct invitation for all users to communicate and discuss about
      the portfolio.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 11: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
      should feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It feels to me that Tunatopas wants to have an open source of
      communication and is willing to talk to users about their design choices
      in this experience. It comes across personally as an open invitation to
      see the choices behind the creation of the portfolio.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 12:What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you
      and what makes that part frustrating?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The footer/final section was the most frustrating for me personally. While
      it was nice to have different interactions for each phrase, it felt like
      the text should have been clickable for the other segments or have a
      different type of interaction, such as clicking the mouse to have the text
      move around instead of hovering over everything.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 13:What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
      what makes that part satisfying?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most satisfying part was the pixel displacement effect. It was a very
      aesthetically pleasing interaction which was fun to interact with,
      especially when you leave the mouse hovering in the centre and having the
      pixels stay in place before moving the mouse.
