<!-- 9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
The portfolio references LinkedIn, Line and email. This is listed as forms of communication between the users and Tunatopas while allowing the users to learn more about them through their LinkedIn profile.
 10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience? It communicated that the developer encourages communication between the users as they seem to be more than happy to discuss their choices and passions for creating an immersive experience. The ‘feel free to contact me’ is a direct invitation for all users to communicate and discuss about the portfolio.

11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? It feels to me that Tunatopas wants to have an open source of communication and is willing to talk to users about their design choices in this experience. It comes across personally as an open invitation to see the choices behind the creation of the portfolio.

12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating? The footer/final section was the most frustrating for me personally. While it was nice to have different interactions for each phrase, it felt like the text should have been clickable for the other segments or have a different type of interaction, such as clicking the mouse to have the text move around instead of hovering over everything.

13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
The most satisfying part was the pixel displacement effect. It was a very aesthetically pleasing interaction which was fun to interact with, especially when you leave the mouse hovering in the centre and having the pixels stay in place before moving the mouse.-->
