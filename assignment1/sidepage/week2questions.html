    <h1>Week 2 Analysis Questions</h1>
    <h3>
      Question 1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when
      interacting with the experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first interaction I noticed was the four vibrant backgrounds that
      altered the view of the mouse as I moved. I instantly moved the mouse to
      each corner to see the differences between the bold wording. The
      paragraphs were quite inspiring and was a great way for myself as a user
      to connect with Palat Tunatopas’ work and see their passions for their
      career and aspirations.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of
      each of your discrete actions.
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Most interactivity based on mouse movements rather than clicking</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Most elements can be interacted with</li>
      </ul>
      <li>very sensitive to mouse movement</li>
      <li>
        On different devices such as an iPad or iPhone, the interactions are
        restricted to tap rather than hovering, which can be difficult to
        interact with certain elements as a result, such as the pixel
        displacement effect
      </li>
      <li>4 distinct sections:</li>
      <ul style="font-style: italic">
        <li>4 colours</li>
        <li>Triangle</li>
        <li>Pixel Displacement Effect</li>
        <li>Contact me - Interactive footer</li>
      </ul>
      <li style="font-weight: bold">First section - 4 colours</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Contrasting colours makes it easier to see the text on each side while
          having the colours still vibrant and match each other through the
          contrasts (example: Yellow text on purple background, blue text on
          pink background and vice versa)
        </li>
        <li>Very bright colours</li>
      </ul>
      <li style="font-weight: bold">
        Second Section - Triangle (Perfectly Center Div)
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Has a ‘field’ around it, when the mouse moves into the field the
          triangle and text shift
        </li>
        <li>Can not be clicked on</li>
      </ul>
      <li style="font-weight: bold">
        Third section - Pixel Displacement Effect
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mouse has a ‘field’ around it, where the pixels move around to
          accomodate the mouse
        </li>
        <li>
          Pixels displace - giving a 3d pattern (larger gaps between pixels
          around the field and smaller gaps between pixels further away from the
          mouse)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li style="font-weight: bold">Final section - Interactive Footer</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Letters move around, change colour and spin when mouse hovers over any
          letter
        </li>
        <li>7 different texts - 7 different movements</li>
        <li>
          Email, LinkedIn and link are the only ones you can click on, takes
          user to a different page accordingly
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The only 3 clickable interactions</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Question 3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time
      engaging with?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The pixel displacement effect was the section I spent the most time with,
      it was an aesthetically pleasing experience that was fun to move and
      interact with as it was the experience that had the most interactivity.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
      with the experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The most common action was hovering the mouse over everything on the
      website to see the full scope of the experience.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
      interactive experience?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I believe the intended goal of the experience was to create an interactive
      portfolio that displayed the creators beliefs.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
      goal?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The main source of text is the first experience with a brief description
      of who the designer is, which gives the impression of their intended goal,
      aided with the other experiences as a showcase of the designers skills and
      interests.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 7: What is your impression of how the experience should be
      interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I believe that it is an experience you interact with for short amounts of
      time. It is a smaller-scale experience so after a user has interacted with
      everything, there is not much else for them aside from checking out the
      developer’s LinkedIn, however it is quite empty and does not show the
      users much about Tunatopas and their other work.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Question 8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should
      be interacted with over time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I do not believe that the experience communicates that. Personally, it
      feels like a showcase of Tunatopas’ portfolio with no clear indication of
      how long it should be interacted with.
