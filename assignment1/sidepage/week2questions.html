<!-- 1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
The first elect I noticed was the four vibrant backgrounds that altered the view of the mouse as I moved. I instantly moved the mouse to each corner to see the differences between the bold wording. The paragraphs were quite inspiring and was a great way for myself as a user to connect with Palat Tunatopas’ work and see their passions for their career and aspirations.

2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
* Most interactivity based on mouse movements rather than clicking
    * Most elements can be interacted with
* 4 distinct sections
    * 4 colours
    * Triangle 
    * Pixel displacement effect
    * Contact me - interactive footer
* Very sensitive to mouse moving
* First page - 4 colours
    * Contrasting colours makes it easier to see the text on each side while having the colours still vibrant and match each other through the contrasts (example: Yellow text on purple background, blue text on pink background and vice versa)
    * Very bright colours
* Triangle - perfectly centre div 
    * Has a ‘field’ around it, when the mouse moves into the field the triangle and text shift
    * Can not be clicked on
* Pixel displacement effect
    * Mouse has a ‘field’ around it where the pixels move around to accomodate the mouse
    * Pixels displace - giving a 3d pattern (larger gaps between pixels around the field and smaller gaps between pixels further away from the mouse)
* Palat tuntaopas
    * Letters move around, change colour and spin when mouse hovers over any letter
    * 7 different texts - 7 different movements 
    * Email, LinkedIn and link are the only ones you can click on, takes user to a different page accordingly 
        * The only 3 clickable interactions

3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
The pixel displacement effect was the section I spent the most time with, it was an aesthetically pleasing experience that was fun to move and interact with as it was the experience that had the most interactivity.

4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
The most common action was hovering the mouse over everything on the website to see the full scope of the experience.

5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
I believe the intended goal of the experience was to create an interactive portfolio that displayed the creators beliefs.

6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
The main source of text is the first experience with a brief description of who the designer is, which gives the impression of their intended goal, aided with the other experiences as a showcase of the designers skills and interests.

7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
I believe that it is an experience you interact with for short amounts of time. It is a smaller-scale experience so after a user has interacted with everything, there is not much else for them aside from checking out the developer’s LinkedIn, however it is quite empty and does not show the users much about Tunatopas and their other work.

8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
I do not believe that the experience communicates that. Personally, it feels like a showcase of Tunatopas’ portfolio with no clear indication of how long it should be interacted with.-->
