<!-- Main Page - My intention in creating the home page was to mimic the first section of Tunatopas' portfolio.
 
I had some issues with creating this, in particular with getting the table to center and take up as much space on the page as possible. 
I also had issues with creating the linked text to have the intended colours, which is written in the code, however it did not show as those colours when displayed, which could be due to changing the colour on a link rather than plain text.
The fonts for the entire website utilised the 2 fonts shown on the portfolio; Arial for the main text and Bolded Comic Sans for the headings, which help it to stand out and catch the users eye.-->
